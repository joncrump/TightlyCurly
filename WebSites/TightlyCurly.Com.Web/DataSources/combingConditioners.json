		"description":"<p>This conditioner has great moisturizing ingredients and a nice lemon verbena scent. It combed really well, and I was done combing sooner than usual, so that was exciting. When it dried in my hair, it clumped well, and my hair was really glossy (if you normally add a bit of oil to conditioners, use a bit less for this one because it was already pretty emollient). For those of you who don't like silicones, this product is silicone free. It also makes a great rinsing conditioner.</p><p>Alaffia says it uses sustainable ingredients, and is donating 10&#37; of it's profits to humanitarian projects in West Africa, so you can feel good about buying this, too. (Oh! I should mention that I didn't feel as comfortable about the ingredients in their shampoos. If memory serves me correctly, I think they are using saponified oils, which usually means the oil has been mixed with lye (or something very alkaline like lye), so it can often be too drying.)</p>",

These fragrance oils can be irritating to sensitive skin. However, it doesn't seem to have much of a scent (that I could tell), so there probably isn't much of them in there. This conditioner combed and clumped really well. So, my only concern is the essential oils which may be too much for very sensitive skin. Other than that concern, this conditioner worked really well. It didn't seem to be really moisturizing (but just slightly, and that could be just in my mind), so if you wanted you could put about a teaspoon of natural oil like olive oil in a full bottle and shake it really hard to make it more moisturizing. That, or you could wait for your hair to dry after using it, and smooth a bit of olive oil (or another oil of your choice) over the ends before braiding it up at night.

And for a while I was worried it might not be slippery enough for combing (it has Stearamidopropyl dimethylamine, as the third ingredient, so I wasn't sure if there was enough of this present to be slippery), so I must admit I wasn't quick to try it. There are few things more annoying than to step out of the shower after washing and conditioning, and then find the conditioner I just put in my hair won't let the Denman through my hair, so I have to get back in the shower and rinse it off and put in something else. But many kind people recommended it highly, so I finally broke down and tried it. To my surprise, it combed nicely, and clumped very well. Ingredient's wise, it's very similar to the relatively newly reformulated Hello Hydration. Thank you to everyone who suggested I try this. ",

		"description":"<h3>Please read this entire entry before trying a Wen product.</h3><p>Okay, this is a long one...Wen conditioner is one of the conditioners I get asked about all the time. And for most of that time I didn't recommend it because I felt it was expensive, the essential oils were irritating, and there were tons of other products out there that could do the same thing. But I guess if Wen's a product a person really wants to try, there isn't anything harmful for the hair in it, and it does its job with combing and keeping our hair moisturized. Because of it's essential oils, it would work well as a rinsing conditioner or a no-po conditioner. However, I must confess, I have ulterior motives for putting it here besides it simply working fine: I wanted to include a conditioner with nearly identical ingredients as all the others I recommend, but this one actually says on the bottle that it's okay to leave in your hair.</p><p>Wen is basically a simple conditioner. It has nearly identical ingredients to all the other conditioners I recommend. The two main differences it has over other conditioners are 1) Marketing and 2) Irritation:</p><p>Marketing: Wen is basically a regular conditioner, ingredients-wise (using the same ingredients that are in many lotions and leave-in hair products as well). It's just that it says on the bottle you can use it for conditioner-washing, and you can use it as a leave in (which is something this site talks about already for these ingredients), whereas most other conditioners don't say this about their products. Those other products want you to spend the money on buying as many different redundant items in their product line as possible. Wen's slant is that they market their conditioner as being able to do all these things in one product, but then they charge you a bunch for it (about $20-30 a bottle). But again, it's just marketing. These are still all the same ingredients that are in regular conditioners, but Wen is saying you can leave them in, and use them to wash with as well. Because it markets itself as being natural, people often don't question what's really in it. </p><p>Irritation: Wen contains very very strong and irritating essential oils, including menthol, and fig extract, among others. This is a very strong product. These strong essential oils are put in the product to make your scalp &quot;tingle&quot; so it feels like it's being cleansed. But in reality it's just irritation. When I was looking up ingredients that were in the Wen product, I was fussing to Jon about how surprised I was at some of the highly irritating ingredients it had. So he became curious, and wanted to try Wen for himself. He has really sensitive skin, and we both felt it would be a good test to see how this product would affect someone with skin like his.</p><p>When he came back from the shower, he shook his head and handed me back the bottle. He said he ended up having to shampoo the Wen conditioner out because it was hurting his scalp, and it was still hurting a bit. Days later you could still see it red and blotchy through his hair. So do be careful with this product. When I used the Wen conditioner, it was really strong on my scalp, but it didn't hurt when I combed it and left it in. So I was totally fine, but Jon wasn't.</p><p>In summary: This product combs well, and clumps the hair well. The essential oils may be way too strong for anyone with sensitive skin, so please, please don't use Wen products on any one (such as a baby or a pet), who isn't able to let you know it's hurting their skin. Use this product with extreme caution:</p><p>Don't use this product if you have sensitive skin</p><p>Don't use on any creature that can't let you know it's too strong</p><p>This might be best to use as a rinsing conditioner, or for no-po routines</p><p>I suggest rotating this product with other (preferably unscented) conditioners every week so your scalp doesn't develop sensitivities to some of the ingredients.</p><p>P.S. I know it says to use it also as a shampoo, but I'd say that's a waste. Since it's so expensive (and potentially sensitizing), I suggest using it for only one thing, either as a rinser, a no-po conditioner, or as a combing conditioner. If you use it as a combing conditioner, use a more mild conditioner (if you co-wash) or shampoo (if you like to shampoo), but this product is too expensive to use as a shampoo and a conditioner. It doesn't do anything special that a regular light conditioner or mild shampoo can't do as far as cleansing. And the essential oils are too irritating to use as both a shampoo and a conditioner. It's good to give your scalp a break.</p>",

		"description":"It’s back! Well…sort of. I know it looks weird that I have a conditioner for relaxed hair on an all-natural hair site, but it’s like this: I was in the store, saw the brown Pantene-shaped bottle, and decided to check out the ingredients to see if maybe Pantene had come to their senses and taken the salt out of their conditioner. And they had on this one. So right on the spot I bought the bottle without looking at the front (honestly, I rarely look at the front anyway. I always look at the ingredients first to tell me what the product actually does – the front is just advertising anyway). I didn’t realize I’d actually purchased a bottle of the Relaxed version of the conditioner until I got home. You see, Pantene has split what once was my beloved Relaxed & Natural into two separate conditioners, one for Relaxed hair and one for Natural hair. The only difference I’ve noticed (on a quick glance between the two later) is that two ingredients are switched between the two versions. I haven’t gotten the bottle for Natural yet, but I have been using the Relaxed version (which is basically identical ingredients-wise to the Natural version), so I can recommend the Relaxed version of the conditioner now. I’m hoping soon to get the Natural version so I can add it here as well. The Relaxed conditioner combs well and clumps firmly just as I remembered the old Relaxed & Natural conditioner doing, even with a few ingredient changes (and even though it says it’s for Relaxed hair, the ingredients are the same as for the Natural, so they are essentially the same product).",
